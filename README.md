# The Python Challenge
There were two components for this challenge: (1) analysing the financial records of a company; and (2) modernising the vote-counting process in a small, rural town. In both cases, data analyses were sped up using Python.

## Analysing Financial Records
The records consisted of profits and losses over the span of 86 months. Results indicated that the company obtained a net profit of $38,382,578. Over the period included in the analysis, the month-by-month change was, on average, -$2315.12, with the greatest increase in profit recorded in February 2012 ($1926159) and the greatest decrease in profit recorded in September 2013 (-$2196167).
